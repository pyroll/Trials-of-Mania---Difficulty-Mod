# NOTE: 'shinju' and 'parts' seem to essentially edit the same
# type of thing: boss limbs and add enemies. After digging through
# the files, the only difference between them appears to be
# that 'shinju' deals specifically with the benevodons, and 'parts'
# with everything else. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO SIMPLY COPY PASTE
# THE SAME VALUES FOR SHINJU AND PARTS for the time being until
# I implement a better way to handle them.
