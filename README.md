# Trials-of-Mania---Difficulty-Mod

yaml-testing branch:

Changelog:
- Consolidated functions, class objects, etc.
- introduced yaml files for storing data

In progress:
- debugging Enemy instance output to test_data.yaml (need to deal with name duplicates)
- testing different logic for iterating through files from 'rootDirDict' so as to not cause errors during the editing process
- writing parsing scripts to read JSON files from Kein's serializer and output data to a yaml file
- continue changing Game Files directory structure to be less confusing and not include files that aren't needed
